    "In this notebook, we're going to run a simulation with adaptive setpoint temperatures based on ASHRAE 55, and we are going to compare these with the static setpoints from the COOLBIZ campaign. Also, we are going to run simulations considering the ASHRAE 55 in NV mode, to compare it with MM. We are going to run some simulations  in Sapporo and Naha (some Japanese locations), and also we are going to analyse and visualize the data. This Jupyter Notebook partially replicates the research paper _Extending the use of adaptive thermal comfort to air-conditioning: the case study of a local Japanese comfort model in present and future scenarios_[1].\n",

    "So now, we're going to generate building energy models with setpoint temperatures based on the static setpoints for Japan (i.e. ComfStand takes the value 3) and ASHRAE 55 (i.e. ComfStand takes the value 2). We're going to select the 80% acceptability levels for both (i.e. CAT takes the value 80), and we're going to select the setpoint behaviour to horizontally extend the setpoint temperatures (or comfort limits) when applicability limits are exceeded (i.e. ComfMod takes the value 3).

Once this process is done, accim will let us know if any of the IDFs is not going to work for any reason, and then it will start the output IDF files generation process.
