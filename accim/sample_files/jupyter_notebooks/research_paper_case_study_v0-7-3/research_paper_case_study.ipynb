In this study, 2 different locations, a present and a future scenario, are considered, resulting in 4 different EPW files.\n",

    "The building energy model used is the 2018 IECC DOE Commercial Reference Building Prototype Small Office. It has 6 thermal zones: a thermal zone in the centre of the building (CORE_ZN), surrounded by 4 thermal zones (PERIMETER_ZN_1 to 4), all of them air-conditioned and located on the ground floor, and a non-air-conditioned attic (Figure 3). Since this is a well-known model, no further details are provided, however these are included in the folder with the IDF and EPW files, in an XLS file provided by DOE and named “PNNL_Scorecard_Prototypes_Office_Small.xls” as well as available online in https://www.energycodes.gov/prototype-building-models#Commercial.\n"

    "The next step is applying the adaptive setpoint temperatures. To do so, the function ``addAccis`` needs to be used. Again, the recommended process, suitable for users with no programming background, is:\n",

    "-\t``'temperature difference'`` in argument ``SupplyAirTempInputMethod`` specifies the type of supply air temperature input method for the VRF systems. This is due to the fact that, running simulations in hot weather with high cooling setpoint temperatures might result in little cooling needs, sometimes too little to be used with a generic cooling supply air temperature of 14°C.\n",
    "-\t``Output_keep_existing`` is set to ``False`` in order to not to generate unnecessary results.\n",
    "-\t``Output_type`` is set to ``'standard'``, in order to provide typical results. Other options might be used when a large amount of simulations is carried out and file size needs to be reduced, or when very specific results need to be exported for the testing of the tool.\n",
    "-\t``Output_freqs`` is set only to ``'hourly'``, since aggregation into other frequencies will be performed later in data analysis. If additional frequencies were required, these could be added to the list (i.e. ``['hourly', 'daily', 'monthly', 'runperiod']``)\n",
    "- ``Output_gen_dataframe`` is set to False, since the generation of the panmdas DataFrame containing Output:Variable objects for output customisation is not needed.\n",
    "-\t``EnergyPlus_version`` is set to ``'23.1'``, since that is the version of TestModel.idf.\n",
    "-\t``TempCtrl`` is set to ``'temperature'``, so that the operation of the HVAC system is based on the operative temperature. If ``'pmv'`` was used, setpoints would be ±0.5.\n",
    "-\t``ComfStand`` requested values are ``2`` and ``7``, since these are the numbers respectively for ASHRAE 55 and IMAC-C in NV mode.\n",
    "-\t``CAT`` is set only to ``80``, so that the offset of setpoint temperatures from neutral temperature covers an 80% acceptability.\n",
    "-\t``ComfMod`` requested values are ``0`` and ``3``, since these are respectively for static and adaptive setpoints, and in this study, adaptive setpoints from IMAC-C and static setpoints from Indian Building Code are to be compared.\n",
    "- ``SetpointAcc`` is set to 100, since HVAC units thermostats are considered to be accurate up to the second decimal.\n",
    "- ``CoolSeasonStart`` and ``CoolSeasonEnd`` are set to dates 01/05 and 01/10 respectively, however these are not necessary in this case.\n",
    "-\t``HVACmode`` requested values are ``0``, ``1`` and ``2``, since those are respectively for AC, NV and MM operation modes. In this case study, may be interesting to evaluate the energy performance of MM against AC. Also, may be interesting to see the difference in comfort hours between NV and MM mode.\n",
    "-\t``VentCtrl``, ``VSToffset``, ``MinOToffset`` and ``MaxWindSpeed`` are arguments to control the operation of MM. In this case, the windows are opened when operative temperature exceeds the neutral temperature (``VentCtrl`` is 0) with no offset (``VSToffset`` is 0), and no restrictions in terms of minimum outdoor temperature and maximum wind speed are set (``MinOToffset`` and ``MaxWindSpeed`` are 50).\n",
    "-\t``ASTtol_steps``, ``ASTtol_start`` and ``ASTtol_end_input`` are mainly used to apply some tolerances to make sure there are no hours that fall outside the comfort zone by a little extent. These can also be used to generate an array of setpoint temperatures. In this case, it applies a ±0.1°C offset to heating and cooling setpoints."
