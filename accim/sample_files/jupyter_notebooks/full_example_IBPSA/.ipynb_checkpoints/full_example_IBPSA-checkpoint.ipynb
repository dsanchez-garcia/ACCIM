First of all, given EnergyPlus (any version between 9.1 and 23.1 included) is installed, and accim has been installed by entering 'pip install accim' in the CMD terminal, let's prepare the files we need: the IDF(s) and the EPW(s). Let's see what file we have in the folder and then we'll continue with the IDF(s).\n",
