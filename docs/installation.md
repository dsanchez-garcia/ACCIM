# Installation
In order to use the ACCIM package, EnergyPlus 9.1.0 or 9.4.0 needs to be installed in the default path, which for EnergyPlus is usually "C:\\", therefore the folder created by the installer would be "C:\\EnergyPlusV9-1-0" or "C:\\EnergyPlusV9-4-0". You can try to run it with other 9.1.X or 9.4.X versions, but it's not guaranteed it works since it hasn't been tested.

Afterwards, you just need to pip install it (please note that accim is lowercase):

`pip install accim`

Then you can run it. Please refer to the 'how to use' section.
