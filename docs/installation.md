# Installation
In order to use the accim package, EnergyPlus 9.X.0 needs to be installed in the default path, which for EnergyPlus is usually "C:\\", therefore the folder created by the installer would be "C:\\EnergyPlusV9-5-0" for example. It will work with 9.1.0 to 9.5.0 versions, however in versions 9.1.0 to 9.3.0 you won't get all the expected results in the csv value generated. It has been tested that it works perfectly with 9.4.0 and 9.5.0.

Afterwards, you just need to pip install it (please note that accim is lowercase):

`pip install accim`

Then you can run it. Please refer to the 'how to use' section.
