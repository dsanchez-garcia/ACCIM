   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (2) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 26 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 9 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Severe  ** ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort="BLOCK1:ZONE1 COMFORT CONTROL" invalid Zone or ZoneList Name="BLOCK1:ZONE1" zone previously assigned.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Zone was previously assigned to Thermostat="BLOCK1:ZONE1 COMFORT CONTROL".
   ** Severe  ** ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort="BLOCK1:ZONE3 COMFORT CONTROL" invalid Zone or ZoneList Name="BLOCK1:ZONE3" zone previously assigned.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Zone was previously assigned to Thermostat="BLOCK1:ZONE3 COMFORT CONTROL".
   ** Severe  ** ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort="BLOCK1:ZONE5 COMFORT CONTROL" invalid Zone or ZoneList Name="BLOCK1:ZONE5" zone previously assigned.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Zone was previously assigned to Thermostat="BLOCK1:ZONE5 COMFORT CONTROL".
   ** Severe  ** ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort="BLOCK1:ZONE2 COMFORT CONTROL" invalid Zone or ZoneList Name="BLOCK1:ZONE2" zone previously assigned.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Zone was previously assigned to Thermostat="BLOCK1:ZONE2 COMFORT CONTROL".
   ** Severe  ** ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort="BLOCK1:ZONE4 COMFORT CONTROL" invalid Zone or ZoneList Name="BLOCK1:ZONE4" zone previously assigned.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Zone was previously assigned to Thermostat="BLOCK1:ZONE4 COMFORT CONTROL".
   ** Severe  ** GetStagedDualSetpoint: Errors with invalid names in ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint objects.
   **   ~~~   ** ...These will not be read in.  Other errors may occur.
   **  Fatal  ** Errors getting Zone Control input data.  Preceding condition(s) cause termination.
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=6
   ..... Last severe error=GetStagedDualSetpoint: Errors with invalid names in ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint objects.
   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.
   *************
   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
